# js
Our Javascript code repository, free for forking &amp; more: We are showing with our highly optimized Javascript code that jQuery is not necessary.

Very often you need only a small piece of code to do some very specific - also very often, bigger and bloated JS libraries are then imported into a project, increasing file size and download times dramatically, esp. in the days of not-always-very-fast-mobile-connection efficiency matters.
What we are showing here is simply some optimized JS code to do some often required but simple stuff on your mobile site, like CSS manipulating, initiating an AJAX request etc.

We are proud to share some of our highly optimized Javascript code. All code is released according to the MIT license.
